       " '\\nExercise patience and self-control with your finances. If you wait and save money for what you need, you will pay with cash or a debit card to deduct money directly from your checking account and avoid using a credit card.\\n\\nA credit card is a loan that accumulates interest unless you can afford to pay off the balance in full every month. Credit cards can help you build a good credit score but use them for emergencies only.\\n',\n",
       " \"\\nTake charge of your financial future and read a few basic books on personal finance. Once armed with knowledge, don’t let anyone take you off track, whether a significant other who encourages you to waste money or friends who plan expensive trips and events you can't afford. Research professionals like financial planners, mortgage lenders, or accountants before utilizing their services.\\n\",\n",
       " '\\nOnce you’ve read a few personal finance books, you will understand two rules. Never let your expenses exceed your income, and watch where your money goes. The best way to do this is by budgeting and creating a personal spending plan to track the money coming in and going out.\\n\\nTracking expenses, like your expensive morning coffee, can provide a valuable wake-up call. Small changes in your everyday expenses are under your control and can impact your financial situation. Keeping monthly expenses, like rent, as low as possible can save you money over time and put you in a position to invest in your own home sooner than later.\\n',\n",
       " '\\nA mantra in personal finance is “pay yourself first,” which means saving money for emergencies and your future. This simple practice keeps you out of trouble financially and helps you sleep better at night. The tightest budget should put some money into an emergency fund every month.\\n\\nOnce you get into the habit of saving money, you will stop treating savings as optional and start treating it as a required monthly expense. Many accounts offer the power of compound interest, such as a high-yield savings account, short-term certificate of deposit (CD), or money market account.\\n',\n",
       " '\\nNo matter how young you are, plan for your retirement now. With the power of compound interest, when you start saving in your 20s, you will earn interest not only on the principal you deposit but also on the interest you earn over time, and you will have what you need to retire someday.\\n\\nCompany-sponsored retirement plans are a great choice. Not only do you get to put in pretax dollars, but many companies will also match part of your contribution, which is free money. Contribution limits tend to be higher for 401(k)s than for individual retirement accounts (IRAs), but both are one step closer to financial health.\\n\\n\\n\\nPower of Compound Interest\\n\\nIf you invest $200 a month, averaging a positive return of 9% annually over 40 years, you will save $856,214 for retirement.\\n\\n',\n",

       " '\\nWhen a company offers you a starting salary, calculate whether that salary after taxes meets your financial needs and savings goals. Many online calculators help you see your after-tax salary, such as PaycheckCity.com, and chart your gross pay (total earnings) and net pay (earnings after taxes and other deductions or take-home pay). In 2022, an annual salary of $35,000 in New York netted $28,270 after federal and state taxes, or about $2,356 per month.\\n\\nIn the U.S., low-income earners are taxed at a lower rate than higher-income earners—the higher your salary, the higher the tax rate. A salary increase from $35,000 to $41,000 a year looks like an extra $6,000 per year or $500 per month, but the tax rate will be higher, so it will only give you $4,227, or $352 per month.\\n',\n",
       " '\\nIf you’re uninsured, don’t wait to apply for health insurance. If employed, your employer may offer health insurance, including high-deductible health plans that save on premiums and qualify you for a Health Savings Account (HSA). If you’re under the age of 26, you may be to stay on your parent’s health insurance, an option that has been allowed since the 2010 passage of the Affordable Care Act (ACA).\\n\\nIf you need to buy insurance, investigate the federal and state plans offered by the Health Insurance Marketplace of the ACA. Look at quotes from different insurance providers to find the lowest rates. Research all your options to see if you qualify for a subsidy based on your income.\\n',\n",

Disability insurance protects your ability to earn an income by providing you with a steady income if you are unable to work for an extended period due to illness or injury.\\n\\nIf you want help managing your money, find a fee-only financial planner to provide unbiased advice. Unlike a commission-based financial advisor, who earns money when you sign up with the investments their company markets, a fee-only planner can provide advice in your best interest.\\n\\n\\nHow Do I Choose a Financial Advisor?\\nAn excellent choice for a young adult is a fee-only financial planner. Unlike a commission-based advisor, who earns a commission if they sign you up with their company's investment plans, a fee-only planner has no personal incentive beyond your best interest, so they have no reason not to give you unbiased advice.\\n\\n\\nWhy Is Compound Interest So Powerful?\\nCompound interest is one of the most powerful forces in finance because it grows your money exponentially, which means it can supercharge your savings over time. You earn interest on your principal and on the interest your earn.\\n\\n\\nWhy Did My Paycheck Shrink After My Raise?\\nThe higher your salary, the higher your tax rate. If you just got a raise or took a new job at a higher salary, the change in the marginal tax rate on the additional income will affect your paycheck. For example, if a salary increase of $6,000 per year bumps you up into a higher tax bracket, the percentage of your income that goes to taxes bumps up as well—which will make your paycheck smaller than expected.\\n\",\n",

       " 'An emergency fund is money in a bank account that’s set aside for unplanned expenses, such as medical bills, car repairs or home repairs. An emergency fund can also help you weather a loss of income from job loss or extended illness. Using funds earmarked for unexpected bills can reduce the need and the costs associated with high-interest credit cards or personal loans to pay them.',\n",
       " 'Bankrate recently surveyed Americans regarding the state of their emergency savings, and found:\\nMore than half (51 percent) of people have less than three months’ worth of savings in an emergency fund.\\nIf hit with an unplanned $1,000 expense, 44 percent of people would pay it with their savings, compared with 20 percent who would pay with a credit card, 15 percent who would pay it but have to cut other spending, 10 percent who would borrow from family or friends, and 4 percent who would take a personal loan.\\nHalf of people feel very or somewhat comfortable with their emergency savings, while 48 percent are somewhat or very uncomfortable.\\nMore than one-third of Americans (34 percent) have less in their emergency fund now than they did before the pandemic, while 17 percent report having more now.\\nMore than half of millennials (57 percent) have no emergency savings or couldn’t cover three months’ worth of expenses, compared with 44 percent of Gen Xers and 49 percent of baby boomers.\\nOn the other hand, 19 percent of millennials, 29 percent of Gen Xers and 30 percent of baby boomers have enough emergency savings to cover at least six months’ of expenses.\\nWomen are less equipped than men to handle emergency expenses, with 57 percent unable to cover more than three months’ worth of expenses, compared with 44 percent of men.\\nMeanwhile, more than a quarter of men (27 percent) can handle half a year’s worth of expenses, compared to just 23 percent of women.\\n',\n",
       " 'An emergency fund is an essential part of a solid financial plan. It can help you pay unexpected expenses and avoid taking on more debt from high-interest credit cards or loans.Having an emergency fund can provide peace of mind by ensuring that you have money when a sudden expense happens.A Bankrate financial security survey from January found that:\\nOnly four in 10 Americans have enough emergency savings to cover an unplanned $1,000 expense.\\nNearly half of Americans (49 percent) are saving less money due to inflation.\\nThe findings reaffirm the need for households to have a well-funded stash of cash and that it’s never too soon to start saving for an emergency.“By nature, unplanned expenses are unexpected, so the sooner you’re prepared the better off you’ll be when the inevitable happens,” says Greg McBride, CFA, Bankrate chief financial analyst.Without an emergency fund, your only options may be credit cards, personal loans or asking relatives or friends for money.',\n",
       " '',\n",
       " 'An emergency fund should cover three to six months’ worth of expenses, but saving that amount takes time. To help get you started, begin with small goals, such as saving $5 a day. Then work your way up to a reserve to cover several months’ worth of expenses.Your savings goal will depend on your income and expenses. Focus on having enough to cover expenses, not on replacing your entire income. Essential monthly expenses commonly include housing, utilities, transportation, food, and credit card or loan payments.To determine how much you need to save, add up your total costs per month, and then multiply that total by however many months’ worth of expenses you wish to have on hand.Sole breadwinners, business owners or those with variable incomes should aim for nine to 12 months’ worth of expenses in an emergency fund.',\n",
       " 'The best place to keep your emergency fund is in a high-yield savings account, which offers easy access and pays a competitive yield. Look for banks and credit unions that insure deposits through the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (FDIC) or the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA).Online-only banks are good options for an emergency savings account because they typically offer higher yields and charge lower fees than brick-and-mortar banks. Fees can eat into your emergency fund balance, which makes comparing savings rates and account features key.Also, there’s no need to stick with an account just because you’ve had it a while. Consumers keep their savings accounts for an average of nearly 17 years, according to a January 2022 Bankrate survey, but if the current account charges monthly fees or pays a subpar annual percentage yield (APY), it’s worth some inconvenience to find a new account that offers better terms.',\n",

       " 'A 2021 Debt.com survey found that 8 in 10 Americans budget their money, and most of those budgeters reported that the practice either kept them out of debt or helped them pay off their debt.To find ways to save, you first have to understand where and how you spend. Budgeting helps you distribute your income more efficiently and find ways to reduce or manage your spending. Bankrate’s Home Budget Calculator can help you to set a budget.A budgeting app is another useful tool that can help you calculate income and expenses to provide a dashboard view of your financial situation.',\n",
       " 'The average household spends an average of $3,490 on the necessities of housing, transportation and food, according to a 2021 survey by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). Calculating what your household needs for such necessities is key in determining your emergency fund goal.A budget is a spending plan that helps you to determine how much money you need each month to cover essential expenses. This number can be calculated by adding up monthly costs for housing, food, transportation and other necessities and then multiplying the sum by six, which gives you the amount you need to cover six months of expenses. It will take most households some time to reach the six-month goal.',\n",
       " 'Nine out of 10 Americans indicated they were paid through direct deposit in a 2022 American Payroll Association survey.Direct deposit automatically deposits your paycheck and other funds directly into your checking or savings account, eliminating the need to manually deposit checks. But all your funds needn’t go into just one account. Setting up a split direct deposit allows you to direct a specific amount of money to your emergency fund with the remainder going to your checking account or vice versa. There are also savings apps that can automatically transfer a percentage of your paycheck into a savings account.Automating the process not only simplifies saving, it can also help keep you on track toward your savings goals.',\n",
       " 'According to the Bureau of Economic Analysis, the U.S. personal saving rate was 2.3 percent in October 2022, which is the lowest it’s been since 2005. Personal saving rate is the percentage saved out of one’s disposable income.One way you can boost your savings rate over time is to increase the amount you’re contributing to your emergency fund by 1 percent or a specific sum, until you’ve reached your savings goal. Increasing the amount in increments can help to make the smaller deposit into your checking account appear less noticeable.',\n",
       " 'A financial windfall consists of coming into a significant amount of money, unexpectedly. Of those who receive such a windfall, 70 percent won’t have any of the money left after a few years, according to the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants.At least a part of any windfall that you receive should be used to add to an emergency fund, unless you already have a sufficient one established. Unexpected money can come in the form of a tax refund, bonus, cash gift, inheritance, or winning a contest or the lottery.',\n",
       " 'The average cost of living for one year is $66,928, according to the BLS. The more you can add to your emergency savings, the longer you’ll be able to stay afloat if you end up out of work due to a job loss or illness.Some emergencies require more than a six-month cushion. Being unemployed for more than a year or being hospitalized for several months are both situations where you’ll be glad you have more money saved in your emergency fund.',\n",
       " 'Banks frequently offer cash incentives to new customers for opening new checking or savings accounts. The additional cash can be useful in establishing an emergency fund or adding to an existing one. Currently, banks are offering up to $3,500 in bonuses for opening a new checking or savings account, or to those who refer a friend or family member.In addition to looking for a bank account bonus, another way you can increase your bank account balance is by making sure you’re getting the best return on your money. The best rates can often be found at online banks, which don’t have the overhead costs of maintaining branches.Keeping your savings organized can help keep you on track to meet your financial goals. Consider housing your emergency fund in a separate account than a vacation fund, for instance. This may help prevent you from tapping into emergency savings for other purposes. Some bank accounts allow you to allocate portions of your money into different buckets.',\n",

       " 'Figuring out how to save money while raising a family can seem difficult when your grocery bill is sky-high. Adding some structure into your family’s eating habits and planning meals are two ways to save money on family expenses.Jessi Fearon, a financial coach, mom of three and personal finance blogger, says she plans breakfast, lunch, dinner and snacks for her family weekly. She shops for groceries once a week, based on her meal plan, which includes salads and fresh vegetables. She also\\xa0uses cash\\xa0for grocery shopping so there’s no temptation to pick up extras. Giving yourself a cash limit can keep you from going\\xa0over budget, whereas it may be easier to overspend if you’re swiping a debit or credit card instead.If you’re meal planning weekly, tailor your shopping list to what’s on sale. Jennifer McDermott, a New York City-based consumer advocate with a personal finance comparison website, says your mobile device can be a way to save money on family expenses as you create your menu.She recommends using an app that will\\xa0aggregate sales flyers according to your zip code so you can search for the best deals. You can browse apps to see what’s on sale and build your meal plan for the week or the month around those items. You can also search for apps that will allow you to take advantage of coupons after you’ve paid for your groceries.“All you do is buy the products on the list, snap a picture of your receipt and you’ll get cash back in return,” McDermott says. Some apps allow you to accumulate cash back in your account and once you hit a certain dollar amount, you can request a cash out payment, which is mailed to you as a check.',\n",

She suggests taking advantage of no-cost or inexpensive activities for kids parties, like spending a day at the beach or hosting a sleepover with pizza and cake.McDermott says if your child’s heart is set on a specific venue, you may be able to save by booking at an off-peak time or having a joint party with another child and splitting the cost. Keeping the guest list small means less to plan and is a good money-saving tip for families.',\n",

These same outlets are also great for reselling clothes, shoes, toys, books and anything else your kids have outgrown.Buying used is also a way to save money on family expenses if your kids are involved in sports or extracurricular activities. Durkin Voisin says e-commerce websites are excellent resources for finding used sporting gear and musical equipment. You could consider leasing musical instruments if you’re not sure whether your child will stick with it for the long term.',\n",

Fearon says she sets a spending budget for gifts, which typically ranges from $400 to $600. She keeps a\\xa0separate savings account\\xa0for these funds and budgets a set amount of money to add to the account each pay period to reach her\\xa0savings goal.“That way, when it’s time to buy gifts we know how much we can afford to spend,” she says, “and there’s\\xa0no stress in January\\xa0from trying to pay back credit card bills.”Shopping earlier in the year is another way to snag deals when you’re looking for ways to save money on family expenses. Memorial Day, the Fourth of July and Labor Day are all ripe times for sales. If you prefer shopping online, some websites have special sales in the summer which provide opportunities to rack up savings on gifts.If you plan to swipe a card for holiday shopping, be smart about it. You could use a cash back rewards debit card, such as the one that comes with a\\xa0Discover Cashback Debit\\xa0account, or you could use a credit card. You can then use your reward as a way to save money on family expenses in the new year.Remember to set a budget if you’re spending on credit so you don’t go overboard.

For even bigger potential savings, refinancing your mortgage could lower your monthly payment.If you’re open to something more drastic, you could think about downsizing to a smaller home or rental—perhaps after one or more children have left for college—as a way to save money on family expenses. You could also consider using your home to generate income by renting out a room on a vacation rental website. If you’re considering this route, be sure to check your local housing laws to make sure it’s allowed.

       " 'If interest rates decline, you may be able to reduce the amount you pay toward interest by refinancing your mortgage. Additionally, you may also elect to reduce your loan term significantly.',\n",
       " 'Another way you may be able to save money on interest, while reducing the term of your loan is to make extra mortgage payments. If your lender doesn’t charge a penalty for paying off your mortgage early, consider the following early mortgage payoff strategies.Just remember to inform your lender that your extra payments should be applied to principal, not interest. Otherwise, your lender might apply the payments toward future scheduled monthly payments, which won’t save you any money.Also, try to prepay in the beginning of the loan when interest is the highest. You may not realize it, but the majority of your monthly payment for the first few years goes toward interest, not principal. And interest is compounded, which means that each month’s interest is determined by the total amount owed (principal plus interest).',\n",
       " 'Making an extra mortgage payment each year could reduce the term of your loan significantly.The most budget-friendly way to do this is to pay 1/12 extra each month. For example, by paying $975 each month on a $900 mortgage payment, you’ll have paid the equivalent of an extra payment by the end of the year.',\n",
       " 'Another way you can help reduce the term of your mortgage significantly is to round up. When budgeting for your mortgage payment, round up to the next highest $100 amount. Pay $800 instead of $743. Or $900 instead of $860.',\n",
       " 'The dollar-a-month strategy should be financially feasible if your income increases slightly but consistently over time.Each month, increase your payment by $1. Simply pay $900 the first month, $901 the second month, and so on. For a 30-year, $900-per-month mortgage with a 6% fixed interest rate on a loan of $150,000, you could reduce the term of your mortgage by eight years.',\n",

For one, having one debt paid off means being able to handle any short-term debts such as credit cards. You also end up saving money if you pay off your mortgage earlier, avoiding additional interest that would have otherwise accrued.

       " \"Max FreedmanContributing WriterUpdated Apr 28, 2023Education and organization are two keys to ensuring your business is financially healthy.Properly managing your finances stabilizes your company and makes your business less likely to fail.To manage your company’s finances, make sure to pay yourself, keep good credit, monitor your books and plan ahead.Debt funding for small businesses means interest alongside repayments, while equity funding excludes interest but may come with less control over your company affairs.This article is for business owners who are looking for advice on how to manage company finances.Often, your small business is successful because of your expertise in making your product or providing your service. Unfortunately, you might not be an expert at the other important parts of running a business, such as managing finances. If you don’t have a lot of experience with managing business finances, it can be a challenge, but it’s also crucial to the survival of your business. Here’s how to establish responsible financial habits that put your business on the road to success.\\n\\nTips for managing small business financesHere are a few things you should do as a small business owner to stay on top of your finances.1. Pay yourself.If you’re running a small or midsize business (SMB), it can be tempting to put everything into your day-to-day operations. After all, that extra capital can often go a long way in helping your business grow. Alexander Lowry, a professor and director of the Master of Science in Financial Analysis Program at Gordon College, said small business owners shouldn’t overlook their own role in the company and should compensate themselves accordingly. You want to ensure that your business and personal finances are in good shape.“Many SMB owners, especially at the outset, neglect to pay themselves,” he said. “They [believe] it’s more important to get the business up and running and pay everyone else. But, if the business doesn’t work out, you won’t have ever paid yourself. Remember, you’re part of the business, and you need to compensate yourself as much as you pay others.”\\xa02. Invest in growth.It’s important to set aside money and look into growth opportunities, which can allow your business to thrive and move in a healthy financial direction. Edgar Collado, chief operating officer at Tobias Financial Advisors, said business owners should always keep an eye on the future.“A small business that wants to continue to grow, innovate and attract the best employees [should] demonstrate that they are willing to invest in the future,” he said. “Customers will appreciate the increased level of service. Employees will appreciate that you are investing in the company and in their careers. And ultimately, you will create more value for your business than if you were just spending all your profits on personal matters.”\\xa0Editor’s note: Need a small business loan for your business? Fill out the below questionnaire to have our vendor partners contact you with free information.\\n\\n3. Don’t be afraid of loans.Loans can lead business owners to worry about the financial repercussions of failure. However, without the influx of capital you obtain from loans, you may face substantial challenges when trying to purchase equipment or grow your team. You can also use loan proceeds to boost your cash flow and thus face fewer issues in paying employees and suppliers on time. Plus, the best business loans come with terms and rates that many small business owners can easily accommodate.4. Keep good business credit.As your company grows, you may want to purchase more commercial real estate, acquire additional insurance policies and take out more loans to facilitate these pursuits. With poor business credit, getting approval for these transactions and acquisitions may be more difficult.To keep good credit, pay off all your debt funding as soon as possible. For example, don’t let your business credit cards run a balance for more than a few weeks. Likewise, don’t take out loans with interest rates that you can’t afford. Only seek funding that you can quickly and easily repay.5. Have a good billing strategy.Every business owner has a client that is consistently late on their invoices and payments. Managing small business finances also means managing cash flow to ensure your business is operating at a healthy level on a day-to-day basis. If you’re struggling to collect from certain customers or clients, it may be time to get creative with how you bill them.“Too much cash tied up in unpaid invoices can lead to cash flow problems, a leading cause of business failure,” said James Stefurak, managing editor of Invoice Factoring Guide. “If you have a chronic late-paying customer, which we all do, instead of badgering them with repeated invoicing and phone calls, try a different approach. Change the payment terms to ‘2/10 Net 30.’ This means if the customer pays the invoice within 10 days, they receive a 2% discount off the total bill. If not, the terms are full payment due in 30 days.” [Read related article: What to Do When Customers Won’t Pay Their Bill]6. Spread out tax payments.\\xa0If you have trouble saving for your quarterly estimated tax payments, make it a monthly payment instead, said Michele Etzel, owner of Bayside Accounting Services. That way, you can treat tax payments like any other monthly operating expense. You can also use the best online tax software platforms to streamline your tax payments.7. Monitor your books.This is an obvious practice, but it’s a very important one. Do your best to set aside time each day or month to review and monitor your books, even if you’re working with a bookkeeper. This will allow you to become more familiar with the finances of your business and provide you with a window into potential financial crime.“Do not neglect bank reconciliations and spending some time each month on reviewing outstanding invoices,” said Terence Channon, principal for NewLead LLC. “Failing to do this, especially if a bookkeeper is involved, opens up the business to wasteful spending or even embezzlement.”8. Focus on both expenditures and ROI.Measuring expenditures and return on investment (ROI) can give you a clear picture of which investments make sense and which may not be worth continuing. Deborah Sweeney, CEO of MyCorporation, said small business owners should be mindful of where they spend their money.“Focus on the ROI that comes with each of your expenditures,” she said. “Not doing this means that you can lose money on irrelevant or bad spending bets. Know where you are spending your hard-earned dollars and how that investment is paying off. If it isn’t paying off, cut back and spend a bit more on the initiatives that do work for you and your business.”9. Set up good financial habits.Establishing internal financial protocols, even if it’s as simple as dedicating a set time to reviewing and updating financial information, can go a long way in protecting the financial health of your business. Keeping up with your finances can help you mitigate fraud or risk.“As a small business, we are often strapped for time, money and have vastly inferior technological capabilities, but it shouldn’t prevent any small business owner from implementing some sort of internal control,” Collado said. “This is especially important if you have employees. Weak internal controls can lead to employee fraud or theft, and can potentially get you into legal problems if you or an employee are not abiding by certain laws.”10. Plan ahead.\\xa0There will always be business issues that need to be addressed today, but when it comes to your finances, you need to plan for the future. “If you’re not looking five to 10 years ahead, you are behind the competition,” said Tina Gosnold, founder of QuickBooks specialist firm Set Free Bookkeeping.\\nKey TakeawaySome tips for managing small business finances include paying yourself a salary from your company’s earnings, planning ahead, paying off debt in a timely manner and focusing on your return on investment.\\n\\nTypes of business fundingIt is important to remember that business finances aren’t just about your earnings; they’re also about how you spend your money and where you get it. When it comes to the latter, you should understand the two main funding categories below.Debt fundingDebt funding is a loan that your company repays with interest. Through debt financing, you can quickly access capital that you might not otherwise be able to get for weeks or even months. Bank loans, government loans, merchant cash advances, business credit lines and business credit cards are all forms of debt financing, which you must repay even if your company fails.Equity fundingEquity funding, unlike debt funding, does not always require repayment if your business fails. However, you will likely have to grant your funders a seat at the decision-making table. Venture capitalists, angel investors and equity crowdfunding are all forms of equity funding. To learn more, read our guide to the difference between debt and equity financing.\\nTipDebt funding comprises various traditional loans that require interest payments, whereas equity funding comes with fewer financial risks but requires you to cede more control to other parties.\\n\\nThe importance of managing your business financesThe most important step for any business owner is to educate themselves.

If you’re struggling to collect from certain customers or clients, it may be time to get creative with how you bill them.“Too much cash tied up in unpaid invoices can lead to cash flow problems, a leading cause of business failure,” said James Stefurak, managing editor of Invoice Factoring Guide. “If you have a chronic late-paying customer, which we all do, instead of badgering them with repeated invoicing and phone calls, try a different approach. Change the payment terms to ‘2/10 Net 30.’ This means if the customer pays the invoice within 10 days, they receive a 2% discount off the total bill. If not, the terms are full payment due in 30 days.” [Read related article: What to Do When Customers Won’t Pay Their Bill]',\n",
       " 'If you have trouble saving for your quarterly estimated tax payments, make it a monthly payment instead, said Michele Etzel, owner of Bayside Accounting Services. That way, you can treat tax payments like any other monthly operating expense. You can also use the best online tax software platforms to streamline your tax payments.',\n",
       " 'This is an obvious practice, but it’s a very important one. Do your best to set aside time each day or month to review and monitor your books, even if you’re working with a bookkeeper. This will allow you to become more familiar with the finances of your business and provide you with a window into potential financial crime.“Do not neglect bank reconciliations and spending some time each month on reviewing outstanding invoices,” said Terence Channon, principal for NewLead LLC. “Failing to do this, especially if a bookkeeper is involved, opens up the business to wasteful spending or even embezzlement.”',\n",
       " 'Measuring expenditures and return on investment (ROI) can give you a clear picture of which investments make sense and which may not be worth continuing. Deborah Sweeney, CEO of MyCorporation, said small business owners should be mindful of where they spend their money.“Focus on the ROI that comes with each of your expenditures,” she said. “Not doing this means that you can lose money on irrelevant or bad spending bets. Know where you are spending your hard-earned dollars and how that investment is paying off. If it isn’t paying off, cut back and spend a bit more on the initiatives that do work for you and your business.”',\n",
       " 'Establishing internal financial protocols, even if it’s as simple as dedicating a set time to reviewing and updating financial information, can go a long way in protecting the financial health of your business. Keeping up with your finances can help you mitigate fraud or risk.“As a small business, we are often strapped for time, money and have vastly inferior technological capabilities, but it shouldn’t prevent any small business owner from implementing some sort of internal control,” Collado said. “This is especially important if you have employees. Weak internal controls can lead to employee fraud or theft, and can potentially get you into legal problems if you or an employee are not abiding by certain laws.”',\n",
       " 'There will always be business issues that need to be addressed today, but when it comes to your finances, you need to plan for the future. “If you’re not looking five to 10 years ahead, you are behind the competition,” said Tina Gosnold, founder of QuickBooks specialist firm Set Free Bookkeeping.Key TakeawaySome tips for managing small business finances include paying yourself a salary from your company’s earnings, planning ahead, paying off debt in a timely manner and focusing on your return on investment.\\n',\n",
       " 'It is important to remember that business finances aren’t just about your earnings; they’re also about how you spend your money and where you get it. When it comes to the latter, you should understand the two main funding categories below.',\n",
       " 'Debt funding is a loan that your company repays with interest. Through debt financing, you can quickly access capital that you might not otherwise be able to get for weeks or even months. Bank loans, government loans, merchant cash advances, business credit lines and business credit cards are all forms of debt financing, which you must repay even if your company fails.',\n",
       " 'Equity funding, unlike debt funding, does not always require repayment if your business fails. However, you will likely have to grant your funders a seat at the decision-making table. Venture capitalists, angel investors and equity crowdfunding are all forms of equity funding. To learn more, read our guide to the difference between debt and equity financing.TipDebt funding comprises various traditional loans that require interest payments, whereas equity funding comes with fewer financial risks but requires you to cede more control to other parties.\\n',\n",
       " 'The most important step for any business owner is to educate themselves. By understanding the basic skills needed to run a small business — like doing simple accounting tasks, applying for a loan or drafting financial statements — business owners can create a stable financial future and avoid failure. In addition, organization is a major component of sound money management. Don’t be afraid to consult a professional, but make sure you have a handle on the day-to-day management of your business’s finances, as well as a plan for the future.Max Freedman also contributed to this article.
